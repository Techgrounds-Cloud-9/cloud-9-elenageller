# Loops
 
**There are two types of loops in Python:**
 The while loop and the for loop.
1. The while loop runs while a condition is true. They can run indefinitely if that condition never changes. If your code is stuck in an infinite loop, just press ctrl-c (or command-c on MacOS) to force quit the running code.
2. The for loop runs for a predetermined number of iterations. This number can be hard coded using the range() function, or dynamically assigned (using a variable, the size of a list, or the number of lines in a document). It is also possible to accidentally create an infinite for-loop. You can use the same command (ctrl/cmd+c) to exit your program.

## Key terminology

* An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

* A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

* With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new script.
2. Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
3. Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. 
4. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

## Exercise 2

1. Create a new script.
2. Copy the code below into your script.
 for i in range(10):
    # do something here
3. Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
4. Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
5. Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

## Exercise 3

1. Create a new script.
2. Copy the array below into your script.
* arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
3. Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.

### Exercise 2

* "i" (index) is a temporary variable used to store the integer value of the current position in the range of the for loop that only has scope within its for loop. You could use any other variable name in place of "i" such as "count" or "x" or "number".
* In the syntax, i is the iterating variable, and the range specifies how many times the loop should run. For example, if a list contains 10 numbers then for loop will execute 10 times to print each number.
* In each iteration of the loop, the variable i get the current value.
