# Key-value pairs
 
Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.
Dicts in Python are written using curly brackets {}. You can get values from the dict by calling its key. 

## Key terminology

* The values can belong to any data type and they can repeat, but the keys must remain unique.

* Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

* CSV or comma-separated values is a text file. It consists of comma-separated data.

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new script.
2. Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:

3. Loop over the dictionary and print every key-value pair in the terminal.

## Exercise 2

1. Create a new script.
2. Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
3. Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.

### Exercise 2

``` python

import csv
myFile = open("book1.csv", "r+")
print(myFile.read())

req_info = ["First Name", "Last Name", "Job Titel", "Company"] 
myDict = {
    "First Name": " ",
    "Last Name": " ",
    "Job Titel": " ",
    "Company" : " ",

    }

myDict ["First Name"] = input("WHat is your First Name? ")
myDict ["Last Name"] = input("What is your Last Name? ")
myDict ["Job Titel"] = input("What is your job titel? ")
myDict ["Company"] = input("What is your current company where you work?")

print (myDict) 
writer = csv.writer(myFile)
writer.writerow(myDict.values())
myFile.close()
myFile = open("book1.csv", "r")
print(myFile.read())

```
