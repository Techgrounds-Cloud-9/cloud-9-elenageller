# Functions
 
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. Functions are recognizable by the brackets () next to the function name. These brackets serve as a place to input data into a function.
Functions can return data as a result.

## Key terminology

* A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

* An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new script.
2. Import the random package.
3. Print 5 random integers with a value between 0 and 100.

## Exercise 2

1. Create a new script.
2. Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.
3. Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, <string>!”.

## Exercise 3

1. Create a new script.
2. Copy the code below into your script.
def avg():
    # write your code here
 
x = 128
y = 255
z = avg(x,y)
print ("The average of",x,"and", y, "is", z)
3. Write the custom function avg() so that it returns the average of the given parameters.
