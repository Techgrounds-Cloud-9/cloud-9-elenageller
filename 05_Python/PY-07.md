# Lists
 
You can declare a list of values in a single variable. A list is represented by square brackets  [ ], and each value is separated by a comma.

## Key terminology

* Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage

* append(): append the element to the end of the list.

* insert(): inserts the element before the given index.

* extend(): extends the list by appending elements from the iterable.

* List Concatenation: We can use the + operator to concatenate multiple lists and create a new list.

* enumerate() TO ACCESS PREVIOUS AND NEXT VALUES IN A LIST

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new script.
2. Create a variable that contains a list of five names.
3. Loop over the list using a for loop. Print every individual name in the list on a new line.

## Exercise 2

1. Create a new script.
2. Create a list of five integers.
3. Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:
4. Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).
5. The first result above is created by adding 9 and 80. The second result is created by adding 80 and 16, etc. The last result is created by adding 35 and 9.

### Exercise 2

``` python
a_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print("The list is :" + str(a_list))
for index, elem in enumerate(a_list):
    if(index+1 < len(a_list)):
     sum = elem + a_list[index+1]
     print (sum)
