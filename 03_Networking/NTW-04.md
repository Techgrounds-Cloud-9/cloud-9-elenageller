# Counting in Binary and Hex
 

## Key terminology

bit: one digit (0 or 1) byte: 8 bits.
highest value for a byte = 255 Binary: base 2 (2 digits, 0 and 1), important for IP addressing and subnetting.
Decimal= a 10 based numeral system you can use the numbers from 0 to 9 for numerical notation.
Hexadecimal= based on 16 symbols, 0 to 9 and A to F is also a numeral system with the addition that it uses alphabetical symbols to add up to 16.
Binary - a 2 based numeral system existing out of only 0's and 1's.
Base - represents the symbols available in a counting system.

## Exercise

Translate the following decimal numbers into binary:
Decimal to Binary
16 = 00010000 128 = 10000000 228 = 11100100 112 = 01110000 73 = 01001001

Binary to Decimal 10101010 = 170 11110000 = 240 11011011 = 219 10100000 = 160 00111010 = 58
