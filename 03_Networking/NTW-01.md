#OSI Stack

##Key terminology
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)
The OSI has seven layers while the TCP/IP has four layers.
TCP/IP Reference Model is a four-layered suite of communication protocols. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and IP stands for Internet Protocol.

Both the reference models are based upon layered architecture.
 The physical layer and the data link layer of the OSI model correspond to the link layer of the TCP/IP model. The network layers and the transport layers are the same in both the models. The session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer of the OSI model = the application layer of the TCP/IP model.
In both the models, protocols are defined in a layer-wise manner.
And the data is divided into packets and each packet may take the individual route from the source to the destination.
Difference:
OSI model is a generic model that is based upon functionalities of each layer. TCP/IP model is a protocol-oriented standard.
OSI model distinguishes the three concepts, namely, services, interfaces, and protocols. TCP/IP does not have a clear distinction between these three.
OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done, while TCP/IP protocols layout standards on which the Internet was developed. So, TCP/IP is a more practical model.
In OSI, the model was developed first and then the protocols in each layer were developed. In the TCP/IP suite, the protocols were developed first and then the model was developed.
