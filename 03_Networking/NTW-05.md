# IP addresses


## Key terminology

IP addresses is a logical address that can be assigned to a network device
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4), is the fourth version of the standard that routes Internet traffic and other packet-switched networks.
IPv6 is the next generation Internet Protocol (IP) address standard intended to supplement and eventually replace IPv4
A public IP address identifies you to the wider internet so that all the information you’re searching for can find you.
A private IP address is used within a private network to connect securely to other devices within that same network.
NAT stands for network address translation. It's a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. 
Static NAT - When the local address is converted to a public one, this NAT chooses the same one. This means there will be a consistent public IP address associated with that router or NAT device.
Dynamic NAT - Instead of choosing the same IP address every time, this NAT goes through a pool of public IP addresses. This results in the router or NAT device getting a different address each time the router translates the local address to a public address.

The router assigns each device a unique private IP address so it can send data to the device that’s actually requesting it. Devices on the same network use private IP addresses with the difference in the last digit after dot.

Unless your router malfunctions, two devices should never get the same IP address under this system. Your router knows which IP addresses are already in use and won't give them out twice. More commonly, an IP conflict can occur when you assign static IP addresses on your network. It will temporarily disrupt whatever internet-connected services or programs you're using on your device. There's no harm done, but it's going to have the same effect as if you'd momentarily lost your Wi-Fi
