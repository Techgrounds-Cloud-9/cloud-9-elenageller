# Network Devices
[There is no network without network devices if you want to connect more than two computers together. 

## Key terminology
router
A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection
switch
A switch is a multi-port device that enhances network efficiency. It provides limited routing information about nodes in the internal network and allows systems to connect.
repeaters 
It extends the length of the signal and allows it to transmit over the same network. In other words, it simply copies the signal bit by bit and re-generates at its original strength by operating at the physical layer.
access point 
First, as a regular wired network for wireless devices. Second, like a router for transferring data between different access points.

## Exercise
Study:
Network Devices
The OSI model in relation to these network devices
Supplies:
Your own network
Admin access credentials for your router

Assignment:
Name and describe the functions of common network devices
Most routers have a list of all connected devices, find this list. What other information does the router have about connected devices?
Where is your DHCP server on your network? What are its configurations?

### Overcome challenges
I had to find my router IP address in order ot login as admin to view all connected devices.
Used command: netstat -nr|grep default
