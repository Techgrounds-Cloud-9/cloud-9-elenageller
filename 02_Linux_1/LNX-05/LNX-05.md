# File persmissions


## Key terminology
chmod
chown
chgrp

## Exercise
Create a text file.
Make a long listing to view the file’s permissions. Who is the file’s owner and group? What kind of permissions does the file have?
Make the file executable by adding the execute permission (x).
Remove the read and write permissions (rw) from the file for the group and everyone else, but not for the owner. Can you still read it?
Change the owner of the file to a different user. If everything went well, you shouldn’t be able to read the file unless you assume root privileges with ‘sudo’.
Change the group ownership of the file to a different group.
