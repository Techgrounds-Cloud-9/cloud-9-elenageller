# Advantages of the cloud

AWS lists six advantages of cloud computing. These are basic characteristics of the cloud that make it attractive for companies to use. Important to note that it also is a marketing tool for AWS to introduce the cloud to new customers. As such, it is an important part of the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam.

### Results 

**The six advantages listed are:**

1. Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx)

The Cloud allows you to trade your CAPEX (Capital Expenses) to OPEX (Operational expense or variable expense). This means that instead of investing in data centers and servers, you will only pay for what you are consuming and when you are consuming it. It will allow you to focus on delivering new products instead of maintaining and create your own infrastructure.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

Because cloud providers sell to a lot of different customers (economic of scale), it would be impossible that you would achieve that kind of price by building your own infrastructure.

3. Stop guessing capacity

One of the biggest problems of creating your own infrastructure is to know how much capacity you will need over time. In the case of an e-commerce website, you might have more traffic during Black Friday, which will make you over-provision your resources. With cloud computing, you can scale up and scale down depending on what you need.

4. Increase speed and agility

With cloud computing, all the services you might need are one click away. If you would like to run a docker image, no need to install Docker on a virtual machine, you can just spin up a cloud service that allows you to build and run your Docker images.

5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers

Security is partially delegated to your cloud provider. In the case of a MySQL database service hosted by your cloud provider, you won’t have to update and patch to the last version of MySQL, your cloud provider will be doing that for you. By default, most of the cloud services are using default strong encryption which is enough in most cases if you don’t deal with highly restricted data.

6. Go global in minutes

Cloud computing allows you to deploy your solutions worldwide in different data centers. This can allow you to reduce the latency for your users as well as being ready for any disaster recovery like a major incident in one of the data centers (fires, tornados, …).
