# Cloud 9 Retro of Week 5

## What went well?
* Interactive exercises were pretty interesting to do.

## What could have gone better?

More time for studying needed. 
Since we have to document even thoeretical part there is not much time left to study more for new topics, which I did in the evenings.

## What can we do to improve?

We could use a more efficient way of studying of new topics. TRy sample tests, mayve use Reskill more.
