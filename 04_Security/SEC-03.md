# Identity and Access Management
 
Security goes in two steps: authentication and authorization. Both are two different actions that happen whenever you log in.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a common way to improve security.
It is best practice to follow the principle of least privilege for authorization.


## Key terminology

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism: knowledge, possession, and inherence.
Authentication is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. I
Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular.
The principle of least privilege (PoLP) refers to an information security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform his/her job functions.

### Results

The key difference between authentication and authorization is that the user’s or service’s identity is confirmed through authentication, and their access privileges are established through authorization.

MFA is used to authenticate if the identity of a user is genuine. It requires a user to present two or more pieces of evidence, or factors, for authentication. A key goal for MFA is to add additional authentication factors to increase security.

How LOP improves security.

Minimized attack surface
Limited malware propagation and reduced blast radius
Better system stability, due to restricted effect of changes 
Improved audit readiness & proactive compliance
